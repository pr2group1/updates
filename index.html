    <h2>A Dream for Everyone: MRDA ACI Group of Schools Brief History</h2>

    <p>
       MRDA Academic Center, Inc. is a non-stock, non-profit, non-sectarian educational institution in the Province of Camarines Sur, founded in the year 2018 by a group of teachers through the initiative of its school founder, Ms. Elaine Abarientos Daliva. The institution started in a small space on the 3rd floor of Liberty Complex, San Antonio, Calabanga, Camarines Sur, offering LET review and TESDA courses. In the same year, the institution was granted a government permit to operate the Senior High School Program by the Department of Education with 40 pioneering students. In the following year, the institution recorded a significant increase in its enrollment, from 40 students to 225. 
    </p>

    <p>
        In 2019, since the present location can no longer accommodate the number of students, the administration decided to transfer to its current location at San Isidro, Calabanga, Camarines Sur, occupying the old house of the late Engr. Noel Ipo. 
    </p>

    <p>
        In the year 2020, with the assistance of teachers, parents, and school administration, MRDA Academic Center, Inc. was granted the permit to operate the complete basic education program from Kindergarten, Elementary, Junior High School, and Senior High School by the Department of Education. In the opening of its new grade levels, the institution has 650 learners from its K to 12 program during the School Year 2020-2021.
    </p>
        
    <p>
        In 2021, in line with the mission of the institution to be of help to the poor but deserving learners to finish their college degree, MRDA Academic Center Inc. submitted its program application for its first-ever college program to the Commission on Higher Education, and it was given authority to operate the Bachelor of Technical Vocational Teacher Education major in Food and Service Management (BTVTEd-FSM) and accepted 150 first-year college students in School Year 2021-2022 for its night classes.  
    </p>

    <p>
        With the vision of the school founder to make education accessible to all learners, with the help of parents, teachers, and stakeholders, the school extended its operation by opening its branches in the far-flung areas to reach more learners who wish to finish their basic education studies. In the year 2022, the Department of Education granted the permit to operate the Senior High School Program on the Island of Daligan, Tinambac, Camarines Sur, with 67 learners. In the following year, 2023, the new school branch in La Purisima, Tinambac, Camarines Sur, was also given authority to operate elementary level. In 2025, the MRDA Academic Center, Inc., Magarao Branch was also given authority to operate catering  learners from Sitio Calangcaan, Sta. Lucia, Magarao, Camarines Sur.
