    <h3>From Mentor to Researcher: Maam Patricia Elopre at LLICON 2025</h3>

       In every classroom she enters, Ma’am Patricia Mae Elopre—known to many simply as Ma’am Pat—often stands as the quiet yet formidable force in English and research. Her students describe her as the kind of mentor who reads not just their work, but also between the lines, pushing them to think sharper, write clearer, and build stronger foundations for their academic pursuits. For years, she has guided budding researchers with a steady hand and an even steadier intellect. But this time, the spotlight shifts. At the Language and Literature International Conference (LLICON) 2025, Ma’am Pat herself stepped forward—not just as a mentor, but as a researcher. Together with her professor and fellow scholar, Dr. Jesus Cyril Conde, she presented their paper titled “Colonial Discourse in Istoryang Suanoy Oral Narrative Tradition from Mt. Asog, Camarines Sur, Philippines.” The presentation took place on Day 2, Track 1: Language, Literature, and History Teaching, where scholars, educators, and language enthusiasts gathered to exchange critical insights. For someone long known as a meticulous critic of research, seeing Ma’am Pat embody the role of presenter and co-author reveals a deeper truth: that the best teachers never stop learning, questioning, and contributing. This achievement is not only a testament to her academic discipline but also to her humility—to continue venturing into scholarship alongside those she once looked up to. Gratitude was extended to Dr. Conde for his mentorship, and to the Bicol Association of Language and Literature Teachers (BALLT) for providing the platform where voices like Ma’am Pat’s could resonate beyond the classroom. The event was held September 4–6, 2025 at Ateneo de Naga University, under the auspices of MRDA ACI—a gathering where knowledge does not just stay within the four walls of a room, but ripples outward into communities and cultures. Quiet, sharp, and relentless in her pursuit of knowledge, Ma’am Patricia Mae Elopre reminds us that brilliance speaks loudest not in volume, but in impact.
